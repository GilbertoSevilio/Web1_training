	<h3><img src="img/bonfire.png">Personal Information</h3>
	<p><b>Solaire of Astora</b> is a character who appears in Dark Souls. He is an exceptionally skilled warrior who purposefully became Undead so he could visit Lordran in his quest to find the sun. He has become a fan favourite among the Dark Souls community due to his jovial attitude and memorable dialogue, and rampant speculation previously lead some to believe he was Lord Gwyn's firstborn, the God of War who lost his deific status. Depending on the player's actions in Lost Izalith, Solaire will either be available for help as a summon against the final boss, or his descent into madness will force the player to kill him.</p>
	<p>The player first meets him after defeating the Taurus Demon in Undead Burg; after exiting the tower, before turning left and running across the bridge where the Hellkite Dragon lurks, instead turn right to find him gazing at the sun; he is immediately distinguishable by the painted sun emblem across his chest.</p>
